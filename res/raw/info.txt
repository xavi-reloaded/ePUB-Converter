ePUB Converter extract text from a PDF file and put it in a well formed (epubcheck compliant) ePUB file.

PDF extraction based on iText library <http://itextpdf.com/> released under the AGPL license. 

- ePUB Converter IS MADE FOR BOOKS, NOT FOR EVERY TYPE OF PDF (DON'T ASK IT TOO MUCH).
- ePUB Converter doesn't need internet connection (doesn't send your docs somewhere on the net, doesn't have ads).
- ePUB Converter extract text (no text from pictures or from raster PDF).
- ePUB Converter try to extract images (only png, jpg and gif) but puts them at the page's end.
- ePUB Converter try to extract the table of contents if present (or creates a dummy TOC).
- ePUB Converter doesn't extract the font size and style.
- ePUB Converter save the ePUB file in the same folder of PDF file (it uses the PDF filename to generate ePUB filename and the title in the frontpage, so rename the PDF before conversion).
- ePUB Converter works fine only with single column PDF (worse with multi column or tables).
- ePUB Converter can fail extraction (5 of 358 books with v0.8.1 on my Atrix).
